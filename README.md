# Mobile Programming with Java
This is the result of maze game app with DFS and BFS algorithm.


## Motivation
We developed this maze game app to apply graph theory concepts from our algorithm class, specifically Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). 
This project allows us to deepen our understanding of these algorithms through hands-on implementation.

## Project Structure

For simplicity, We have implemented class diagrams with class names only. </br>

1. MainActivity.java: </br>
-  MainActivity serves as the start screen, providing a button that navigates to UserInputActivity.</br>

2. UserInputActivity.java: </br>
-  UserInputActivity allows the user to input the number of rows and columns for the maze, then starts MazeActivity with the specified dimensions.</br>

3. MazeActivity.java: </br>
-  MazeActivity generates a maze with the specified size, provides functionality for character movement, and allows pathfinding to the exit.</br>

4. MazeView.java: </br>
-  MazeView is a custom view used to visually display the maze generated in MazeActivity.</br>

5. SolutionActivity.java: </br>
-  SolutionActivity displays the shortest path found in MazeActivity on the screen.</br>
